# Generative Agents
Generative Agents are computational software that simulate human behavior in interactive applications. They use a combination of memory, reflection, and planning to produce believable individual and group behavior. These agents can remember past experiences, draw conclusions about themselves and others, and create action plans based on their environment. They can be used in various applications such as immersive environments, interpersonal communication rehearsal spaces, and prototyping tools. In a sandbox environment similar to The Sims, generative agents can interact with each other, form relationships, and coordinate group activities while users observe and intervene.
