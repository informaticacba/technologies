# CAMEL
CAMEL stands for Communicative Agents for "Mind" Exploration of Large Scale Language Model Society. It is a framework aimed at improving the cooperation between AI chat agents to complete tasks with minimal human input. It focuses on developing scalable methods to comprehend the thought processes of these agents and addresses the obstacles they encounter while cooperating effectively. CAMEL employs role-playing and inception prompting to guide chat agents toward task completion, ensuring alignment with human intentions. This approach offers a valuable resource for studying agent behaviors and capabilities, as well as promoting research in communicative agents. By tackling cooperation challenges, CAMEL holds the potential to boost the efficiency of conversational AI systems.
